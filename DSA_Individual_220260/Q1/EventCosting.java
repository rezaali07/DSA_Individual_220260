// Question 1 (a)

// You are a planner working on organizing a series of events in a row of n n. Each venue can be decorated with
// one of the k available k. However, adjacent n should not have the same theme. The cost of decorating
// each venue with a certain theme varies.
// The costs of decorating each venue with a specific theme are represented by an n x k cost matrix. For example,
// costs [0][0] represents the cost of decorating venue 0 with theme 0, and costs[1][2] represents the cost of
// decorating venue 1 with theme 2. Your task is to find the minimum cost to decorate all the n while adhering
// to the adjacency constraint.
// For example, given the input costs = [[1, 5, 3], [2, 9, 4]], the minimum cost to decorate all the n is 5. One
// possible arrangement is decorating venue 0 with theme 0 and venue 1 with theme 2, resulting in a minimum cost of
// 1 + 4 = 5. Alternatively, decorating venue 0 with theme 2 and venue 1 with theme 0 also yields a minimum cost of
// 3 + 2 = 5.
// Write a function that takes the cost matrix as input and returns the minimum cost to decorate all the n while
// satisfying the adjacency constraint.
// Please note that the costs are positive integers.
// Example: Input: [[1, 3, 2], [4, 6, 8], [3, 1, 5]] Output: 7
// Explanation: Decorate venue 0 with theme 0, venue 1 with theme 1, and venue 2 with theme 0. Minimum cost: 1 +
// 6 + 1 = 7.
